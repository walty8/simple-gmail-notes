**This is a _Chrome exntension_ that adds notes to Gmail conversations. One note per conversation.**

- 100% free and open source! 

- Notes marked on one computer could be retrieved from another computer.

- All notes are stored in your own Google Drive account, no 3rd party server is used.
 
- All communications and authentications are directly between your browser and Google Drive.

- The extension could only access those Google Drive files that are created by it. 

- An offline Google Drive token would be collected to avoid logging in every time the Gmail is opened. But you could disconnect (revoke the token) any time.

- No tracking code is added.

- See the extension website for the source code repository.
